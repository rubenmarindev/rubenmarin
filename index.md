# Welcome to My Portfolio Page on Github

My name is Rubén Marín and I am a back-end developer passionate about creating amazing projects. With a focus on back-end development and a keen eye for database modeling, I strive to build functional and highly performanced projects in Ruby On Rails.

## Projects

Here are a few examples of my recent projects:

- [Project 1](https://github.com/rubenmarindev/test_bank): A Ruby On Rails web application with banks and providers related, CRUD forms in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and with postgresql database. The authentication was done with the devise gem.
- [Project 2](https://github.com/rubenmarindev/alpha_blog): A blog application using Ruby on Rails framework, with a simple authentication and front with HTML, CSS, JQuery and Bootstrap. The database is postgresql.
- [Project 3](https://github.com/rubenmarindev/test_api): An API project designed to relate and publish two models, done with TDD Methodology and with authentication based on Auth0.
